# 🌞 SolarGrid AI Dashboard

A responsive and intelligent dashboard for monitoring and managing solar power distribution using AI-based optimization techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

SolarGrid AI Dashboard is a web application designed to visualize real-time solar power generation, consumption, and distribution across multiple grid units. It leverages artificial intelligence to optimize power flow, reduce losses, and improve overall energy efficiency in a solar grid system.

This project was built as part of a hackathon focused on sustainable and smart energy solutions.
